# About me

Hello everyone! 

I'm Data Scientist | ML Engineer with experience in neural network development. 

I have experience in the full development cycle of ML solutionsâ€”from problem definition and data processing to integration and deployment in production. 

Developed machine learning models for practical problems, including:
* Multi-class classification for event analysis;
* [Binary image classification using convolutional neural networks;](https://github.com/Elena-Apo/diploma) 
* Regression modeling of behavioral trajectories aimed at predicting movement.

Skills:
- Programming languages: Python, C++
- Machine learning: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow / Keras, Perceptron, CNN, LSTM
- Data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, data visualization via Matplotlib
- Tools: Jupyter, Git
- Mathematics: linear algebra, statistics
- ML metrics and analytics: MAE, RMSE, F1-score, Accuracy, ROC-AUC
